As Fawn learns more about Gruff, she uncovers a prophecy warning that the NeverBeast’s presence is tied to a series of storms that threaten Pixie Hollow. While Tinker Bell and other fairies initially distrust Gruff, Fawn is determined to prove he means no harm. Together, they navigate tensions between protecting Pixie Hollow and helping Gruff fulfill his mysterious purpose. The film beautifully explores themes of friendship, courage, and empathy, emphasizing the importance of looking beyond appearances to understand others.
